<b>Smart-Platform-Services</b> is a set of directories which contains Docker service YAMLs and configuration files of <b>FIWARE Foundation</b> Generic Enablers (GE) necessary to setup an initial Smart Platform. The whole stack is deployed and managed under a Docker Swarm Cluster.

Smart-Platform-Services consists of three directories, `services`, `config` and `scripts`:

- `services` directory consists of all the Docker YAML files which contain instructions for the deployment of the FIWARE GE.
- `config` directory consists of all the configuration files needed by the Docker services YAML files.
- `scripts` directory holds two setup scripts used for automatic configuration and setup/deployment of the platform.

<u><i>Note</i></u>: The following manual was written for deployments on Ubuntu/Debian-alike systems. The scripts were tested on a system with Ubuntu 18.04. No warranty can be given for compatibility with other versions or linux distributions.

## Prerequisites ##
Before you set up the platform on your VM or server, a few prerequisites must be fulfilled:

- You need a managable domain `<domain-name>` with control over DNS records and the possibility of creating additional subdomains. These subdomains will be used to access the various web interfaces and services the platform is composed of.  
The following subdomains must be created:

	* `accounts`.\<domain-name\>  
	<i>Needed for: [Keyrock - Identity Management](https://github.com/ging/fiware-idm)</i>
	* `apis`.\<domain-name\>  
	<i>Needed for: [APInf - API Management Framework](https://github.com/apinf/platform)</i>
	* `cadvisor`.\<domain-name\>  
	<i>Needed for: [cAdvisor - Docker Monitoring](https://github.com/google/cadvisor)</i>
	* `charts`.\<domain-name\>  
	<i>Needed for: [Grafana - Open source analytics & monitoring](https://github.com/grafana/grafana)</i>
	* `dashboards`.\<domain-name\>  
	<i>Needed for: [Wirecloud - Web dashboard platform](https://github.com/Wirecloud)</i>
	* `data`.\<domain-name\>  
	<i>Needed for: [CKAN - Open Data publication platform](https://github.com/conwetlab/FIWARE-CKAN-Extensions)</i>
	* `knowage`.\<domain-name\>  
	<i>Needed for: [Knowage - Business Intelligence platform](https://github.com/KnowageLabs)</i>
	* `market`.\<domain-name\>  
	<i>Needed for: [Marketplace based on Biz Framework - Context API/Data monetization](https://github.com/FIWARE-TMForum/Business-API-Ecosystem)</i>
	* `ngsiproxy`.\<domain-name\>  
	<i>Needed for: [NGSI Proxy - Redirection of NGSI notifications to web pages](https://github.com/conwetlab/ngsi-proxy)</i>
	* `nifi`.\<domain-name\>  
	<i>Needed for: [Apache NiFi - Data flow and transformation](https://github.com/apache/nifi)</i>
	* `perseo`.\<domain-name\>  
	<i>Needed for: [Perseo - Complex Event Processing (CEP)](https://github.com/telefonicaid/perseo-core)</i>
	* `umbrella`.\<domain-name\>  
	<i>Needed for: [APInf Umbrella - open source API management platform (based on API Umbrella)](https://github.com/Profirator/api-umbrella)</i>

- Make sure you can provide an e-mail address used by certbot (tool for setting up [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) certificates) for account registration and recovery. All externally exposed services will be served via HTTPS.

- Allow incoming traffic on port 443 (HTTPS) on your VM.

- You must have a SMTP server ready for sending out e-mails to the platform users (register at a provider of your choice or set up a server on your own which won't be covered by this guide).

- A Docker Hub account is required for pulling required Docker images. Go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) to create an account.

## How to deploy? ##

**Preperation of VM**

First of all, update/upgrade your VM and install some additional packages.

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y && sudo apt-get install -y zip unzip git
```

Deploy wildcard certificates from Let's Encrypt for your domain.  
Before executing the certbot command, please replace `<email>` with your e-mail address used for account registration and recovery of your certificates, e.g. `me@example.org`  
Please also change the placeholder `<domain-name>` to your domain name, e.g. `mydomain.org`

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get install software-properties-common -y

sudo add-apt-repository universe -y && sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot -y && sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get install certbot python-certbot-nginx -y

sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns-01 --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --email <email> --no-eff-email --manual-public-ip-logging-ok --agree-tos -d *.<domain-name>
```

After running the above command, add the DNS TXT record provided by Letâ€™s Encrypt certbot to your DNS server.


**Step 1 - Check out the project files:**

Checkout this repository with your Git credentials.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SmartMaaS-Services/dev.smartmaas.services.git
```

**Step 2 - Deploy docker services in a Docker Swarm:**

Change to your local repo directory. It currently contains two setup scripts for configuration and setup of the platform services which are going to be deployed as Docker services. Be sure to have execution rights set for both scripts.

```bash
cd dev.smartmaas.services
chmod u+x scripts/setup-part*
```
Deploy services in Docker Swarm by running the first script. The following options are supported:

<pre>
<i>Mandatory options:</i>  
<b>--login-user</b>  logged-in (or SSH) user that will be added to the docker user group 
<b>--hub-user</b>    Docker Hub username  
<b>--hub-pwd</b>     Docker Hub password  
<b>--smtp-server</b> SMTP server address  
<b>--smtp-user</b>   SMTP account user  
<b>--smtp-pwd</b>    SMTP account password  
<b>--domain</b>      domain name  
<b>--stack</b>       stack name for the Docker Swarm - can be chosen freely and will be used as name prefix for Docker container and networks 

<i>Optional options:</i> 
<b>--version</b>     prints out the script's version  
<b>--help</b>        prints out usage information and these options
</pre>

<u><i>Note</i></u>: Put option values into single quotes ('') to prevent special characters from being interpreted by the shell.

```bash
./scripts/setup-part1.sh --login-user '<linux-login-user>' --hub-user '<dockerhub-username>' --hub-pwd '<dockerhub-password>'
			 --smtp-server '<smtp-server>' --smtp-user '<smtp-user>' --smtp-pwd '<smtp-password>'
			 --domain '<domain-name>' --stack '<swarm-stack-name>'
```

**Step 3 - APInf Umbrella configuration and Identity Manager (IDM) setup:**

Open <b><i>https://<span></span>umbrella.<code>&lt;domain-name&gt;</code>/admin</i></b> in your browser and register the first user - the admin - for the installed [APInf Umbrella](https://github.com/Profirator/api-umbrella) service. APInf Umbrella (a fork of [API Umbrella](https://apiumbrella.io/)) acts as a proxy that sits in front of the services of the Smart Platform and adds functionality like API keys, rate limiting, and analytics. 
After creation of the admin user you should be redirected to the management dashboard of APInf Umbrella. 

- Go to `'Users' -> 'Admin Accounts'` and select the admin account you've just created by clicking its e-mail address. Copy the Admin API Token and put it in place of `<admin-auth-token>` from the next command.

- The internal Admin API of APInf Umbrella requires an additional standard user to perform admin requests. These requests will be sent by the second setup script to make the services of the platform (each addressed by one of the created subdomains) reachable behind APInf Umbrella.  
Go to `'Users' -> 'API Users'` and add a new API user. Fill out the `User Info` section (you can use the same e-mail address as the admin user) and click "Save". The new account should appear in the list of API users. Open it, copy the user's API Key and replace the `<api-key>` placeholder in the shell command.

<u><i>Note</i></u>: Also don't forget about the single quotes ('') here.

```bash
./scripts/setup-part2.sh --domain '<domain-name>' --api-key '<api-key>'
			 --token '<admin-auth-token>' --stack '<swarm-stack-name>'
```
